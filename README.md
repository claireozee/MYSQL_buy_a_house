# MYSQL_buy_a_house

I completed an 8 week Data & SQL course with Code First Girls. By the end of the course, the aim was that I should be able to create a relational database and query it based on a given business question.

I find the topic of house prices in London interesting, so I found a dataset on Kaggle and based my project around it. The ultimate question is - where is the best place to buy a house in London?
